## Enterprise App Deployment, Simplified.

PSAppDeployToolkit is a versatile solution that streamlines and standardizes the process of software deployment, making it easier than ever to manage your IT environment. It has a comprehensive set of features, such as dynamic logging, user interaction capabilities, and customizable functionality.

### Standardize and enhance every software deployment

PSAppDeployToolkit allows you to encapsulate a typical Windows Installer MSI or Setup executable to provide it with enhanced capabilities.

- Validate prerequisites such as dependencies on minimum software versions
- Ensure that in-use applications are closed and prevent reopening during the deployment
- Check with the user if now is a good time to start an install and allow them to defer
- Uninstall existing applications and perform clean up operations
- Capture any important settings that may be required for an upgrade or migration
- Run the installation silently and capture logs in the event of an issue
- Run post-installation configuration tasks to customize for your environment
- Prompt the user to restart their computer if required, immediately, on a timer and with a deadline
