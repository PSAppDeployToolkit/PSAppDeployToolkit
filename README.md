PSAppDeployToolkit is a framework for deploying applications in a business / corporate environment. It provides a set of well-defined functions for common application deployment tasks, as well as user interface elements for end user interaction during a deployment. It simplifies the complex scripting challenges of deploying applications in the enterprise, provides a consistent deployment experience for your end users and as a result of this, improves the overall success rate of your deployments.

### Features

PSAppDeployToolkit allows you to encapsulate a typical Windows Installer MSI or Setup executable to provide it with enhanced capabilities.

- Validate prerequisites such as dependencies on minimum software versions
- Ensure that in-use applications are closed and prevent reopening during the deployment
- Check with the user if now is a good time to start an install and allow them to defer
- Uninstall existing applications and perform clean up operations
- Capture any important settings that may be required for an upgrade or migration
- Run the installation silently and capture logs in the event of an issue
- Run post-installation configuration tasks to customize for your environment
- Prompt the user to restart their computer if required, immediately, on a timer and with a deadline
