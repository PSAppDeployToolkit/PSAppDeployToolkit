Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, your feedback and contributions are appreciated.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure all the necessary information is provided to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

Please note there is a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Reporting Bugs / Submitting Feature Requests

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/psappdeploytoolkit/psappdeploytoolkit/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/psappdeploytoolkit/psappdeploytoolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of PSADT that is being used (found in the AppDeployToolkitMain.ps1)
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *develop* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - I'd hate for your time to be wasted.

To send a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Checkout the *develop* branch
3. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. Please refrain from code styling changes, it will be harder to focus on your change.
4. Ensure local tests pass.
5. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
6. Send a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/psappdeploytoolkit/psappdeploytoolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues is a great place to start.
