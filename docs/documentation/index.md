# WPF UI Docs

**WPF UI** is a library built for [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/getting-started-with-wpf) and the [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) language.  
To be able to work with them comfortably, you will need:

- [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- .NET desktop development  
  _(Additional workload in Visual Studio)_

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code are two different programs. If you want to create WPF apps, it's possible to compile them in Visual Studio Code, however for comfortable work we recommend [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

## Installation

You can install **WPF UI**, the library for the Windows Presentation Foundation framework, in several ways.

- Directly specify the `Wpf.Ui.dll` file in your application's project file (`.csproj`).
- Copy the library source code into your application codebase.
- Use the **NuGet** package manager.

We recommend using the **NuGet** package manager, it allows you to easily install and update your application dependencies.
