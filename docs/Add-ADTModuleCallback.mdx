## SYNTAX

```powershell
Add-ADTModuleCallback [-Hookpoint] <CallbackType> [-Callback] <CommandInfo[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This function adds a specified callback function to the nominated hooking point.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell

## PARAMETERS

### -Hookpoint

Where you wish for the callback to be executed at.

Valid hookpoints are:
* OnInit (The callback is executed before the module is initialized.)

* PostClose (The callback is executed after the deployment session is closed.)
* OnFinish (The callback is executed before the last deployment session is closed.)
* OnExit (The callback is executed after the last deployment session is closed.)

Each hook point supports multiple callbacks, each invoked in the order they're added.
