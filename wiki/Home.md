## Introduction

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit provides a set of functions to perform common application deployment tasks and to interact with the user during a deployment. It simplifies the complex scripting challenges of deploying applications in the enterprise, provides a consistent deployment experience and improves installation success rates.

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit can be used to replace your WiseScript, VBScript and Batch script wrappers with one versatile, re-usable and extensible tool.

## Features

**Easy To Use -** Any PowerShell beginner can use the template and the functions provided with the Toolkit to perform application deployments.

**Consistent -** Provides a consistent look and feel for all application deployments, regardless of complexity.

**Powerful -** Provides a set of functions to perform common deployment tasks, such as installing or uninstalling multiple applications, prompting users to close apps, setting registry keys, copying files, etc.

**User Interface -** Provides user interaction through , customizable user interface dialog boxes, progress dialogs and balloon tip notifications that can all be branded with custom logo and banner.

**Localized** - The UI is localized in several languages and more can easily be added using the XML configuration file.

**Integration -** Integrates well with SCCM 2007/2012; provides installation and uninstallation deployment types with options on how to handle exit codes, such as supressing reboots or returning a fast retry code.

**Updatable -** The logic engine and functions are separated from per-application scripts, so that you can update the toolkit when a new version is released and maintain backwards compatibility with your deployment scripts.

**Extensible -** The Toolkit can be easily extended to add custom scripts and functions.

**Helpful -** The Toolkit provides detailed logging of all actions performed and even includes a graphical console to browse the help documentation for the Toolkit functions.

## System Requirements and Support

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit has been developed (and tested) to work with a wide range of Operating Systems from Windows XP to Windows 8.1 (and the Windows Server equivalents) to provide enterprise-wide compatibility. The system requirements are as follows:

  - PowerShell 2.0

  - Windows NT 5.1 and above

While we have attempted to maintain this backwards compatibility through the lifecycle of the toolkit, the degree of testing performed across older Operating Systems such as XP and Vista is limited as the bulk of testing is performed on the latest OS versions. However, the toolkit has widespread adoption in the enterprise from SMEs to large multinationals so there is safety in numbers and the assurance that the toolkit has been put through its paces on hundreds of thousands of clients around the globe.
