Oh ...  I\'m not talking about the long overdue v4. I\'m talking about the new website!\\r\\n\\r\\nPSAppDeployToolkit is feeling revitalized, and kinda cute, so it was only fair that we apply a fresh coat of paint to the site. And it\'s not just a little bit of paint, we\'ve been working on this for a while now. \\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s New?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve completely re-built the site from the ground up, and we\'ve added a bunch of new features. We\'ve invested a lot of time in improving the flow of the documentation, so it\'s easier to follow and quicker to get up to speed with the toolkit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we\'ve created an all-important reference guide for the toolkit\'s Exit Codes, Variables and Functions to the top of the page, so it\'s easy to find.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Stay Tuned!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn\'t the only new thing on the horizon. More news very very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDan, Sean & Mo."}]}')}}]);
