Version 3.0.9 [11/29/2013]
	Note	We recently attempted to add a killer new feature and release 3.1.0. We thought we had nailed it but ended up hitting problems once we went into production environments.
			Worse still, we ended up causing a bunch of problems in 3.0.8 trying to reverse out all of these changes. 
			We've prided ourselves on getting to be a really stable toolkit that works well in an enterprise environment. 
			So we're very sorry for the shoddiness of 3.0.8 and have taken a number of steps (a QA process and test scripts) to ensure we don't have these issues going forward.

	Added example advanced Office 2010 deployment script
	Asynchronous actions now write to the same log file as synchronous actions
	Changed Defer Exit Code default to 5000. In CM07, deployments with deferrals should be set on a recurring schedule (ie, every 4 hours, not just As Soon As Possible). In CM12, the Application Model evaluates once a day by default (can be changed in Client Settings)
	Fixed Get-ScheduledTask not running on non-English system
