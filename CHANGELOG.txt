  - The function now doesn't call Close-InstallationProgress when running in async mode
- Changed Show-InstallationRestartPrompt:
  - Reworked the window to look consistent with Show-InstallationWelcome
- Changed Show-InstallationProgress:
  - Reworked the window to look consistent with Show-InstallationWelcome
  - Function now logs when it is being bypassed due to Deploy Mode
- Changed Set-ActiveSetup:
  - Fixed an issue where the function was adding executed active setup registry key when -ExecuteForCurrentUser $false was specified
  - Function now checks the Active Setup registry key to evaluate whether to execute the StubPath based on the IsInstalled property
- Fixed typo in Stop-ServiceAndDependencies saying "start" instead of "stop"

  - Function now gets bypassed in Silent Deploy Mode
- Changed Execute-ProcessAsUser:
  - The function now escapes invalid xml characters prior to using them in a xml file
- Fixed signatures for a couple of functions inside AppDeployToolkitMain.cs based on official documentation - No breaking changes
- Performance improvements across the toolkit
- Fixed a bug in Set-ItemPermission where SID translation did not work correctly
- Changed Show-BalloonTip:
  - Function Show-BalloonTip now logs when it is being bypassed
  - Added parameter -NoWait for asynchronous execution
  - The icon tooltip now contains Title - Text
- Fixed an issue where $envLogonServer would start with backslashes
- Fixed an issue where some global variable did not get cleared on exit
  - This caused an issue if you ran multiple toolkits in the same powershell session. It would use the same log file for all toolkits.
  - This only occured if you used the .ps1 files directly. Deploy-Application.exe opens a new session each time.
- Added function Set-Shortcut that allows you to change existing shortcuts
- Added function Get-Shortcut to retrieve information from a shortcut
- Changed New-Shortcut:
  - BREAKING CHANGE: IconIndex parameter is now an Integer. It was previously incorrectly specified as a String.
  - Reworked the way this function sets shortcut to run as admin
  - Added additional checks for the input Path in order to provide better log messages and better handling of relative paths
  - Improved function help text
- Changed the way Execute-MSI handles paths for Transforms and Patches:
  - The only accepted separator is now a semi-colon. Commas can be a part of the paths now.
  - Double quotes are removed from the paths before the entire string is wrapped in double quotes.
- Encoding of the files has been changed back to UTF8 with BOM, back from UTF8 without BOM:
  - We chose to go with UTF8 without BOM because it is the encoding for Powershell v6+ and because it is one of the most popular encodings in the world.
    However this caused issues on Windows Powershell for clients that use a different language from English. Due to Microsoft's chaotic coding decisions, Powershell uses the BOM as a verification that the code is written with non-English characters.
    In their own words:"It's not possible to force PowerShell to use a specific input encoding. PowerShell 5.1 and below, running on Windows with the locale set to en-US, defaults to Windows-1252 encoding when there's no BOM.
    Other locale settings may use a different encoding. To ensure interoperability, it's best to save scripts in a Unicode format with a BOM."
  - Just like changing to UTF8 without BOM, this will not affect the size of the files or their functionality. BOM or Byte Order Mark is just one special character, placed at the start of the files.
    If you do not use the toolkit on machines with a different language, then this will have no effect on you or your clients. It will however help everyone else display the text in their language correctly.

**Version 3.8.3 [01/10/2020]**
- Added function Set-ItemPermission that allows you to easily change permissions on files or folders.
- Added setting READ permissions to BUITLTIN\Users for toolkit's temporary folder so they can get the popup message.
- Added -AddParameters for Execute-MSP, that lets you add additional parameters.
- Added -ExecuteForCurrentUser for Set-ActiveSetup, which allows you to disable executing the StubExePath for the current user.
- Added -UseShellExecute for Execute-Process:
  - WindowStyle Hidden doesnt usually work without this parameter on. CreateNoWindow will usually not work without this off.
  - This parameter changes the way the application is started. It is similar to entering a path into the Run dialog or into the Windows Explorer. If it is a file not an application, then the Shell will open it in a program assigned for this extension. The Shell does not stand for command shell but for operating system shell. It also changes how Working Directory is used.
  - If this parameter is set to $true there is no output/error stream. Only an exit code. Default value is $false which was also the case before, however you couldnt change it through parameters previously.
  - Expanded description for WindowStyle, CreateNoWindow and WorkingDirectory parameters.
- Added return value for Execute-Process with -PassThru and -NoWait specified: Returns an object with Id, Handle and ProcessName.
- Added config paths to the config file for installations where RequireAdmin is False.
- Added revised documentation which is now included as a PDF.
- Changed Variables to no longer rely on the system variable PATH for system applications.
- Changed default -Source value for Write-Log to a more useful value: it will be set to Parent's function name and if not inside a function then the name of the script. If not inside a function or a script, then the value will be set to 'Unknown'.
- Changed UnBlock-AppExecution and Block-AppExecution so they don't run without admin rights. Instead of throwing an error, they only write and entry to the log.
- Changed Execute-MSI so when the action is Patch, two variables REINSTALL and REINSTALLMODE are appended to parameters as specified here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec#update-options
- Changed timestamp of compressed toolkit logs to 24h format to avoid possible double filenames.
- Changed Get-ScheduledTask to Get-SchedulerTask to resolve the conflict on Windows 10 and added an alias on Powershell versions where this function does not exist.
- Changed logging inside Convert-RegistryPath to be disabled by default, to decrease log clutter.
- Changed registry paths to no longer use registry PSDrives and contain full paths.
- Changed Show-InstallationPrompt so the window scales with the amount of text entered and removed unused space. If there is no icon specified, the text will scale the entire width too.
- Changed Show-InstallationRestartPrompt so it restarts the computer in Silent and VerySilent deploy modes.
  - Added NoSilentRestart parameter for the function to retain previous behaviour, which defaults to True.
  - Renames 'Restart Later' to 'Minimize' to make it more clear to the user.
- Fixed visual bugs in Show-InstallationWelcome.
  - The application name is now always displayed.
  - Fixed uncentered text.
  - Height of the window is now not limited and scales with the text.
  - Removes unused variables.
- Fixed uses of Execute-Process throughout the toolkit with the -PassThru parameter since -PassThru no longer ignores exit codes.
- Fixed issue with $envOSVersionRevision not being populated on Windows 8 because the "UBR" registry value is only being checked if "$envOSVersionMajor = 10".
- Fixed an issue where the correct ProgramFiles and CommonProgramFiles paths were not populated if the Toolkit was launched from a 32-bit process on a 64-bit OS.
- Fixed Powershell 2.0 issues with GetHostEntry and GetFolderPath.
- Fixed the issue with config file being read incorrectly and showing incorrect charaters in the UI.
- Fixed Get-UserProfiles so it ignores "defaultuser0" account.
- Fixed a rare issue in Execute-ProcessAsUser causing an error, because of a negative index for SubString.
  - Improved logging in the function.
  - CMD will now be started silently without a popup just like powershell.

**Version 3.8.2 [08/05/2020]**

Security Notice

- Fixed security issue that could allow elevation of privilege related to the toolkit temp file path [Reserved CVE-2020-10962]
  - The script temp file path was set to a location that was writeable by a standard user. This is set in the configuration XML.
  - This security risk only affects deployments that use the Show-InstallationWelcome function with the parameter -BlockExecution or the internal function Block-AppExecution AND are running with elevated permissions AND can be exploited only while the script is running.
  - To further minimize the risk of an attacker using this to gain additional permissions, it has been moved to a write-protected location.
  - Note: This change will break deployment scripts that run with Standard User rights. While this has been technically possible to do, we are not aware of anyone doing this. As such, we feel this is the safest course of action for the overall PSADT userbase.
  - Additionally, a standalone PowerShell script was created, to identify and remediate the issue on existing PSAppDeployToolkit deployment packages. It can be found here:
    - https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/blob/master/Sources/Set-ToolkitTempPath.ps1

Breaking Changes

- Changed behavior of parameters in Execute-Process. This is a breaking change which may require changes to deployment scripts:
  - Changes to behavior are being made to reduce confusion around the wording of parameters when a custom workflow is required.
  - No changes required if your deployment script does not have custom handling of exceptions / exit codes.
  - ContinueOnError was scoped to ignore non-zero exit codes. It now operates at the function level and will allow continuing if an unknown exception occurs.
  - If Passthru was specified, all non-zero exit codes and exceptions were ignored. Now, both event types cause a Script Failure.
	- To ignore specific exit codes, use the new IgnoreExitCodes parameter, using * to ignore all.
	- To stop the script if the process fails, use the ExitOnProcessFailure parameter.
  - Execute-Process would fail if an exception occurred, even when ContinueOnError was specified. It now ignores exceptions as expected.
  - ContinueOnError now ignores exceptions as expected. To ignore specific exit codes, use the IgnoreExitCodes parameter.

Other

- Added new parameters to the Execute-MSI function:
  - NoWait. Allows immediately returning to the script once the process has been started, without waiting for it to complete (Default: False).
  - IgnoreExitCodes. Allows ignoring specific or all exit codes returned by the process (Default: None).
  - PriorityClass. Allows changing the process priority immediately after process starts (Default: Normal).
  - ExitOnProcessFailure. Allows setting the script to immediately stop if the process fails and returns the exit code to the caller (e.g. SCCM) (Default: True).
  - RepairFromSource. Allows rewriting local msi cache and repair installation from source
- Added new parameters to the Execute-Process function:
  - IgnoreExitCodes. Now supports ignoring all exit codes returned by the process (Default: None).
  - PriorityClass. Allows changing the process priority immediately after process starts (Default: Normal).

- Added PersistPrompt parameter to Show-InstallationWelcome and Show-InstallationPrompt. Prompt window is persistently returned to center screen after interval specified in config file (default 10 seconds). For Show-InstallationWelcome, this only takes effect if deferral is not available to user. The user will have no option but to respond to the prompt - resistance is futile!
- Added example advanced Office 2010 deployment script
- Asynchronous actions now write to the same log file as synchronous actions
- Changed Defer Exit Code default to 5000. In CM07, deployments with deferrals should be set on a recurring schedule (ie, every 4 hours, not just As Soon As Possible). In CM12, the Application Model evaluates once a day by default (can be changed in Client Settings)
- Fixed Get-ScheduledTask not running on non-English system
- Fixed error deleting deferral history in registry on successful installation.

**Version 3.0.2 [08/29/2013]**

- Added CheckDiskSpace and RequiredDiskSpace parameters to Show-InstallationWelcome
  - If CheckDiskSpace parameter is used, disk space will be evaluated before showing the Welcome screen. If disk space requirements are not met, an error message will be displayed and a Fast Retry (1618) exit code generated. The disk space requirements are calculated automatically based on the size of the source files or by specifying the required space in MB using the RequiredDiskSpace parameter.
- Added Get-FreeDiskSpace function (returns value in MB)
