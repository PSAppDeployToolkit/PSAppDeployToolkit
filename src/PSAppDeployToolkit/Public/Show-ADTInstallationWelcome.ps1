function Show-ADTInstallationWelcome
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Show a welcome dialog prompting the user with information about the deployment and actions to be performed before the deployment can begin.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The following prompts can be included in the welcome dialog:

        * Close the specified running applications, or optionally close the applications without showing a prompt (using the `-Silent` switch).
        * Defer the deployment a certain number of times, for a certain number of days or until a deadline is reached.
        * Countdown until applications are automatically closed.
        * Prevent users from launching the specified applications while the deployment is in progress.

    .PARAMETER CloseProcesses
        Name of the process to stop (do not include the .exe). Specify multiple processes separated by a comma. Specify custom descriptions like this: `@{ Name = 'winword'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Word' }, @{ Name = 'excel'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Excel' }`

    .PARAMETER HideCloseButton
        Specifies that the 'Close Processes' button be hidden/disabled to force users to manually close down their running processes.

    .PARAMETER AllowDefer
        Enables an optional defer button to allow the user to defer the deployment.

    .PARAMETER AllowDeferCloseProcesses
        Enables an optional defer button to allow the user to defer the deployment only if there are running applications that need to be closed. This parameter automatically enables `-AllowDefer`.

    .PARAMETER Silent
        Stop processes without prompting the user.

    .PARAMETER CloseProcessesCountdown
        Option to provide a countdown in seconds until the specified applications are automatically closed. This only takes effect if deferral is not allowed or has expired.

    .PARAMETER ForceCloseProcessesCountdown
        Option to provide a countdown in seconds until the specified applications are automatically closed regardless of whether deferral is allowed.

    .PARAMETER ForceCountdown
        Specify a countdown to display before automatically proceeding with the deployment when a deferral is enabled.

    .PARAMETER DeferTimes
        Specify the number of times the deployment can be deferred.

    .PARAMETER DeferDays
        Specify the number of days since first run that the deployment can be deferred. This is converted to a deadline.

    .PARAMETER DeferDeadline
        Specify the deadline date until which the deployment can be deferred.

        Specify the date in the local culture if the script is intended for that same culture.

        If the script is intended to run on en-US machines, specify the date in the format: `08/25/2013`, or `08-25-2013`, or `08-25-2013 18:00:00`.

        If the script is intended for multiple cultures, specify the date in the universal sortable date/time format: `2013-08-22 11:51:52Z`.

        The deadline date will be displayed to the user in the format of their culture.

    .PARAMETER DeferRunInterval
        Specifies the time span that must elapse before prompting the user again if a process listed in 'CloseProcesses' is still running after a deferral.

        This addresses the issue where Intune retries deployments shortly after a user defers, preventing multiple immediate prompts and improving the user experience.

        Example:
        - To specify 30 minutes, use: `([System.TimeSpan]::FromMinutes(30))`.
        - To specify 24 hours, use: `([System.TimeSpan]::FromHours(24))`.

    .PARAMETER WindowLocation
        The location of the dialog on the screen.

    .PARAMETER BlockExecution
        Option to prevent the user from launching processes/applications, specified in -CloseProcesses, during the deployment.

    .PARAMETER PromptToSave
        Specify whether to prompt to save working documents when the user chooses to close applications by selecting the "Close Programs" button. Option does not work in SYSTEM context unless toolkit launched with "psexec.exe -s -i" to run it as an interactive process under the SYSTEM account.

    .PARAMETER PersistPrompt
        Specify whether to make the Show-ADTInstallationWelcome prompt persist in the center of the screen every couple of seconds, specified in the config.psd1. The user will have no option but to respond to the prompt. This only takes effect if deferral is not allowed or has expired.

    .PARAMETER MinimizeWindows
        Specifies whether to minimize other windows when displaying prompt.

    .PARAMETER NoMinimizeWindows
        This parameter will be removed in PSAppDeployToolkit 4.2.0.

    .PARAMETER NotTopMost
        Specifies whether the windows is the topmost window.

    .PARAMETER AllowMove
        Specifies that the user can move the dialog on the screen.

    .PARAMETER CustomText
        Specify whether to display a custom message specified in the `strings.psd1` file. Custom message must be populated for each language section in the `strings.psd1` file.

    .PARAMETER CheckDiskSpace
        Specify whether to check if there is enough disk space for the deployment to proceed.

        If this parameter is specified without the RequiredDiskSpace parameter, the required disk space is calculated automatically based on the size of the script source and associated files.

    .PARAMETER RequiredDiskSpace
        Specify required disk space in MB, used in combination with CheckDiskSpace.

    .INPUTS
        None

        You cannot pipe objects to this function.

    .OUTPUTS
        None

        This function does not return any output.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses iexplore, winword, excel

        Prompt the user to close Internet Explorer, Word and Excel.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -Silent

        Close Word and Excel without prompting the user.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -BlockExecution

        Close Word and Excel and prevent the user from launching the applications while the deployment is in progress.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Word' }, @{ Name = 'excel'; Description = 'Microsoft Office Excel' } -CloseProcessesCountdown 600

        Prompt the user to close Word and Excel, with customized descriptions for the applications and automatically close the applications after 10 minutes.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'msaccess' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -PersistPrompt

        Prompt the user to close Word, MSAccess and Excel. By using the PersistPrompt switch, the dialog will return to the center of the screen every couple of seconds, specified in the config.psd1, so the user cannot ignore it by dragging it aside.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -AllowDefer -DeferDeadline '2013-08-25'

        Allow the user to defer the deployment until the deadline is reached.

    .EXAMPLE
        Show-ADTInstallationWelcome -CloseProcesses @{ Name = 'winword' }, @{ Name = 'excel' } -BlockExecution -AllowDefer -DeferTimes 10 -DeferDeadline '2013-08-25' -CloseProcessesCountdown 600

        Close Word and Excel and prevent the user from launching the applications while the deployment is in progress.

        Allow the user to defer the deployment a maximum of 10 times or until the deadline is reached, whichever happens first. When deferral expires, prompt the user to close the applications and automatically close them after 10 minutes.

    .NOTES
        An active ADT session is NOT required to use this function.

        The process descriptions are retrieved via Get-Process, with a fall back on the process name if no description is available. Alternatively, you can specify the description yourself with a '=' symbol - see examples.

        The dialog box will timeout after the timeout specified in the config.psd1 file (default 55 minutes) to prevent Intune/SCCM deployments from timing out and returning a failure code. When the dialog times out, the script will exit and return a 1618 code (SCCM fast retry code).
